## Description

> **Warning**
: Currently in development

A MRI preprocessing tool which provides a dozen of functions easy to use made from some of the most popular Python libraries ðŸš€

It includes :
  - Transformations : skull stripping, resampling, registration, histogram matching, bias field correction, normalization and so on
  - Conversion : Dicom to Nifti, Nifti to Dicom
  - Sorting : an elegant way to organize your Dicom files 
  - Anonymization : Dicom files can be anonymized according to your own rules
  - Visualization : 2D and 3D light viewer
  - Spectroscopy : generation of mask of the MRS voxel/slab
